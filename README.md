# Liver-Tumor-Segmentation

This repository takes CT scan images as input and detects if the patient has a healthy liver or a tumorous one. The technique used here is segmentation using Dynamic UNet Deep Learning Model along with classification using Random Forest and Decision Tree machine learning models and compares all these techniques.
